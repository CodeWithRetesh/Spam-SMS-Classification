# 📩 Spam SMS Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview :

This project is a Machine Learning based Spam SMS Classification system that can automatically detect whether a message is **Spam or Not Spam (Ham)**.

It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning algorithms** to analyze text messages and make predictions.

This project was completely developed step-by-step from scratch as part of practical Machine Learning learning.
